Our project was aimed at allowing users to click pictures of posters around campus, and automatically record and share meaningful information about events, opportunities and contacts. We hoped we could build something that not only allowed a user to automatically detect text and 'create' event from a picture, but also make token-related tags associated to picture,  add functionality for calendar integration from the google calendar api, and share it automatically with nearby people who are interested in events associated with the same tags.
Our attempted to use a host of GCPs online tutorials https://cloud.google.com/ in conjunction with each other and we also explored libraries such as OpenCV, Numpy, NLTK and Flask. We were able to use triggers to deploy background cloud functions, which performed OCR when we uploaded an image to a user set directory and we also simultaneously worked on an android app which would allow a user to interface with the cloud and extract the information required. This was our first time in a hackathon, and for most of us, the first time working extensively with making calls to online APIs, so we could not achieve the speed we wanted in deploying our application. Nonetheless, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and are excited to work further with the pre-mentioned libraries to make an integrated application that could be piloted on Columbia's Campus
